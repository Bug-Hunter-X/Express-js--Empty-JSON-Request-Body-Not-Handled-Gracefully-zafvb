# Express.js: Empty JSON Request Body Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where an empty JSON request body is not handled gracefully. The application fails silently, logging an empty object instead of throwing an error or returning an appropriate response.

## Bug Description

The `express.json()` middleware is used to parse JSON request bodies. However, when an empty request body is sent, the middleware parses it as an empty object. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the application, especially if the application does not explicitly check for an empty object. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding an explicit check for an empty request body and handling it appropriately, returning an error or a default response.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send an empty POST request to `/user` using a tool like Postman or curl.
5. Observe the console output and the response from the server.

## How to Fix

1. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
2. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the fix.
3. Send an empty POST request to `/user` again and observe the improved handling of the request.
